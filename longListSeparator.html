<!--This is an example of how you might use the long list separator.  You could really use it anywhere.
As an example, I used it in a table where I had a long list of three-leter codes that looked like word-vomit
when printed out.  This organizes them nicely into a semi-regular list with little bullets to break up the monotony. -->

<span class="listSpan" ng-repeat="word in words | orderBy: word">
	<a href="..." >{{word}}</a>
</span>
