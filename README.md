## How to convert SVN repos to GIT

I've converted several repositories from subversion to git (and then added them to company-run gitlab instances) and compiled all my notes; mostly for myself, but I used and finessed them enough that I think they're pretty reproducible.  This relies heavily on the existing Atlassian documentation, but there were some weird things I ran into that I had to hunt around to figure out.  Hopefully this will save time for other folks.  I'm sure someone SOMEWHERE is still stuck on Subversion, so do yourself and your coworkers and favor and [switch to git](svn_2_git/README.md)!
